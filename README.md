# Angular4ToDoJsonServer
Basic ToDo app using Json placeholder server and Angular 4

The main motive of this app to provide the basics of Angular4 and json-server. 
I will use this work to help solve Basic Authentication problems with ongoing projects.
I need data to manipulate for this. I always depend on backend and to overcome the problem
not always having one, I have learnt json-server and I have used it in this app.
